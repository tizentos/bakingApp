# bakingApp

This app allows user to watch a step by step guide on how to make a snack. It allows user to navigate between steps seamlessly and uses the recommended exoplayer to stream videos from a ready-made video URL.  It also has a home widget that will enable view information about a snack without launching the main app.

The app has a separate UI for Tablets and non-tablet phones.
